              Books are manâ€™s best friends. Books are portable and so they are
              easy to carry around. And so books can be read at any time night
              or day, while travelling on a bus or train or flight, and at meal
              time too. Books are published in many languages and in varied
              genres. There are books in fiction and non-fiction categories.
              Each of these categories has many different sections and genres,
              and there are many thousands of titles in each type. Every book
              title has an International Standard Book Number (ISBN) that is
              unique to it, and helps in identifying it.
